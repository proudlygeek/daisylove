Loves me, Loves me Not
======================

A pretty amusing *love predictor* system powered by JavaScript, [Raphael.js][2] and some JQuery magic glue.

What?
-----

This is a JavaScript implementation of an ancient French game called ["Loves me, Loves me Not" game][1].

How?
----

1.  Choose if your beloved love is an *He* or a *She*;
2.  Type *His/Her* name into the input field and press *enter*;
3.  A new daisy will be *picked* up and served to you (using a *rather* sophisticate algorithm, *BTW*);
4.  Continue clicking on the petals until they're *depleted*;
5.  Wait for the *response*;
6.  **(Optional)** Share your love results.

Why?
----

Actually It was just an exercise to test the [Raphael.js][2] library which has turned into a little game. Hope you'll enjoy it.
